# Implementation of EKS with Terraform

This repository contains Terraform code to create an EKS cluster on AWS.

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Terraform installed
- kubectl installed
- AWS IAM Authenticator installed
- AWS account with permissions to create EKS clusters and associated resources

## AWS IAM Requirements

Ensure you have the following IAM configurations:

- AWS IAM user with permissions to create EKS clusters and associated resources
- AWS IAM role with permissions to create EKS clusters and associated resources
- AWS IAM policy with permissions to create EKS clusters and associated resources
- AWS IAM group with permissions to create EKS clusters and associated resources
- AWS IAM instance profile with permissions to create EKS clusters and associated resources
- AWS IAM service role with permissions to create EKS clusters and associated resources
- AWS IAM service account with permissions to create EKS clusters and associated resources

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terraform-aws-eks.git
   cd terraform-aws-eks
    ```
2. **Initialize Terraform**:

    ```sh
    terraform init
    ```
3. **Create a `terraform.tfvars` file** with your AWS region and other variables:
    ```hcl
    region = "us-west-2"
    cluster_name = "my-eks-cluster"
   ```
4. **Plan the Terraform deployment**:
    ```sh
    terraform plan
    ```
5. **Apply the Terraform deployment**:
    ```sh
    terraform apply
    ```
6. **Configure kubectl** to use the new EKS cluster:
    ```sh
    aws eks --region us-west-2 update-kubeconfig --name my-eks-cluster
    ```
7. **Verify the EKS cluster**:
    ```sh
    kubectl get svc
    ```
8. **Destroy the Terraform deployment** when done:
    ```sh
    terraform destroy
    ```
## Notes
- Ensure you have the correct AWS region set in your `terraform.tfvars` file.
- You may need to adjust the security group rules and IAM roles/policies based on your specific requirements.
- This code is for educational purposes and should be tested in a non-production environment before use.
- Make sure to clean up any resources created by Terraform to avoid unexpected charges.
- You can customize the Terraform code to add additional resources such as VPC, subnets, and security groups as per your requirements.
- You can also use modules to organize your Terraform code better and make it reusable.
- Consider using Terraform workspaces to manage different environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod) within the same codebase.
- You can use Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise for remote state management and collaboration.
- You can also use Terraform modules from the Terraform Registry to simplify your code and leverage community best practices.
- You can use tools like `pre-commit` to enforce code quality and formatting standards in your Terraform code.
- You can use `terraform-docs` to generate documentation for your Terraform modules automatically.
- You can use `tflint` to lint your Terraform code and catch potential issues before applying changes.
- You can use `terraform-compliance` to ensure your Terraform code complies with your organization's policies and standards.
- You can use `checkov` to scan your Terraform code for security vulnerabilities and best practices.
- You can use `tfsec` to perform static analysis of your Terraform code and identify security issues.
- You can use `infracost` to estimate the cost of your Terraform resources before applying changes.
- You can use `terraform-docs` to generate documentation for your Terraform modules automatically.
- You can use `pre-commit` hooks to enforce code quality and formatting standards in your Terraform code.
